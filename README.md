Creating an ERP system in order to learn full stack development. Using FastAPI framework for backend and next.js for frontend.

Frameworks: FastAPI (For backend API using Python)

Database: using a sqlite db for quick development. Can be switched easily in db_url setting later in db.py.
plan to move db_url to an env variable.
